# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework Assignment

Project Description:
The VBA Challenge is Homework Assignemnt #2 for the UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp. With this assignment, we used VBA to automate what would be repetitive/painful tasks in excel. 

Features:
The script performs the same on every sheet, and creates a summary table of the ticker prices, their yearly changes (from a $ and % standpoint) and total volume point of view. From there, we isolate a few specific tickers based on their performance (highest / lowest % growoth, greatest total volume).
